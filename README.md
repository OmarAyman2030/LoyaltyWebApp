# LoyaltyWebApp
The primary objective of the platform is to create a robust loyalty system that allows merchants to reward customers for their purchases and engagement. This includes features such as earning points, redeeming rewards, and accessing exclusive offers, all of which are aimed at increasing customer retention and driving sales.
